# CMU Multimodal SDK Data Processing Pipeline: A Comprehensive Technical Review

## Abstract

The CMU Multimodal SDK represents a significant advancement in multimodal machine learning research by providing a standardized pipeline for processing and aligning multimodal data. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of the data processing methodologies employed by the SDK for each modality—text, visual, and audio. We examine the mathematical foundations, algorithmic implementations, and design rationales behind the preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, and temporal alignment strategies. The SDK's approach to handling the inherent challenges of multimodal data, including varying sampling rates, missing modalities, and temporal asynchrony, demonstrates sophisticated engineering that has enabled reproducible research across the multimodal sentiment analysis community.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Multimodal sentiment analysis requires the integration of information from multiple heterogeneous sources—typically text, audio, and visual modalities. Each modality presents unique challenges in terms of data representation, temporal dynamics, and feature extraction. The CMU Multimodal SDK addresses these challenges through a unified framework that standardizes the processing pipeline while maintaining flexibility for diverse research applications.

The fundamental challenge in multimodal processing lies in the disparate nature of the data sources. Text appears as discrete tokens with variable timing, audio signals are continuous waveforms sampled at high frequencies (typically 16kHz or higher), and visual information comes as sequences of frames captured at specific frame rates (usually 30 fps). The SDK must reconcile these differences to create aligned, meaningful representations suitable for machine learning models.

### 1.2 SDK Architecture Overview

The CMU Multimodal SDK employs a hierarchical processing architecture consisting of three main stages:

1. **Raw Data Ingestion**: Handling diverse input formats and converting them to standardized representations
2. **Feature Extraction**: Applying modality-specific algorithms to extract meaningful features
3. **Temporal Alignment**: Synchronizing features across modalities to a common timeline

Each stage involves sophisticated algorithms and mathematical transformations that we will examine in detail throughout this review.

## 2. Text Modality Processing Pipeline

### 2.1 Text Preprocessing and Tokenization

The text processing pipeline begins with transcript extraction from video content. For datasets like CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, this involves either manual transcription or automatic speech recognition (ASR) with manual correction. The SDK processes text through the following stages:

#### 2.1.1 Tokenization and Cleaning

The tokenization process employs the Penn Treebank tokenization scheme, which handles:

```
Raw text: "I don't think it's worth $10.50!"
Tokenized: ["I", "do", "n't", "think", "it", "'s", "worth", "$", "10.50", "!"]
```

The mathematical representation of tokenization can be formalized as a function:

$$T: S \rightarrow W^*$$

where $S$ represents the string space and $W^*$ represents sequences of tokens from vocabulary $W$.

#### 2.1.2 Forced Alignment

The SDK employs forced alignment using the P2FA (Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner) algorithm to obtain word-level timestamps. This process uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to align phonetic transcriptions with audio signals:

$$\hat{A} = \arg\max_A P(O|A,W) \cdot P(A|W)$$

where:
- $O$ is the observed acoustic features
- $A$ is the alignment hypothesis
- $W$ is the word sequence

### 2.2 Word Embedding Extraction

#### 2.2.1 GloVe Embeddings

For traditional word embeddings, the SDK uses 300-dimensional GloVe vectors trained on Common Crawl data. The GloVe objective function minimizes:

$$J = \sum_{i,j=1}^{V} f(X_{ij})(w_i^T \tilde{w}_j + b_i + \tilde{b}_j - \log X_{ij})^2$$

where:
- $X_{ij}$ is the word co-occurrence count
- $w_i, \tilde{w}_j$ are word and context vectors
- $b_i, \tilde{b}_j$ are bias terms
- $f(x)$ is a weighting function

The weighting function is defined as:

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 
(x/x_{max})^\alpha & \text{if } x < x_{max} \\
1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

#### 2.2.2 BERT Contextual Embeddings

For contextual embeddings, the SDK integrates BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The BERT processing involves:

1. **Tokenization**: WordPiece tokenization with vocabulary size of 30,522
2. **Attention Computation**: Multi-head self-attention mechanism

$$\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

where $Q$, $K$, $V$ are query, key, and value matrices derived from the input embeddings, and $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors.

3. **Layer Aggregation**: The SDK extracts features from the last four layers and concatenates them, resulting in 3,072-dimensional vectors (4 × 768).

### 2.3 Temporal Representation

Text features are represented with timestamps corresponding to word boundaries:

$$F_{text}(t) = \begin{cases}
e_i & \text{if } t \in [t_{start}^i, t_{end}^i] \\
\vec{0} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where $e_i$ is the embedding for word $i$ with start and end times $t_{start}^i$ and $t_{end}^i$.

## 3. Visual Modality Processing Pipeline

### 3.1 Face Detection and Tracking

The visual processing pipeline begins with face detection and tracking across video frames. The SDK employs multiple approaches:

#### 3.1.1 Viola-Jones Face Detection

The initial face detection uses the Viola-Jones algorithm with Haar-like features:

$$f_{haar}(x) = \sum_{white} I(x) - \sum_{black} I(x)$$

The cascade classifier combines weak learners using AdaBoost:

$$H(x) = \text{sign}\left(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t h_t(x)\right)$$

where $h_t$ are weak classifiers and $\alpha_t$ are their weights.

#### 3.1.2 Face Tracking

Once detected, faces are tracked using Kalman filtering:

**Prediction step:**
$$\hat{x}_{k|k-1} = F_k \hat{x}_{k-1|k-1} + B_k u_k$$
$$P_{k|k-1} = F_k P_{k-1|k-1} F_k^T + Q_k$$

**Update step:**
$$K_k = P_{k|k-1} H_k^T (H_k P_{k|k-1} H_k^T + R_k)^{-1}$$
$$\hat{x}_{k|k} = \hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k(z_k - H_k \hat{x}_{k|k-1})$$

### 3.2 Facial Feature Extraction

#### 3.2.1 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) Features

The SDK uses FACET to extract 35 facial action units based on the Facial Action Coding System. Each action unit represents specific muscle movements:

$$AU_i = \sigma(W_i^T \phi(I) + b_i)$$

where $\phi(I)$ represents learned convolutional features from the face image $I$.

The 35-dimensional feature vector includes:
- 20 Action Units (AU1, AU2, AU4, AU5, AU6, AU7, AU9, AU10, AU12, AU14, AU15, AU17, AU18, AU20, AU23, AU24, AU25, AU26, AU28, AU43)
- 15 Additional features (head pose, gaze direction, facial landmarks)

#### 3.2.2 OpenFace Features

OpenFace provides 68 facial landmarks using Constrained Local Neural Fields (CLNF):

$$p(l_i|I, \theta) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\left(-\sum_{i} \phi_i(l_i, I) - \sum_{i,j} \psi_{ij}(l_i, l_j)\right)$$

where:
- $l_i$ are landmark locations
- $\phi_i$ are appearance terms
- $\psi_{ij}$ are shape prior terms

### 3.3 Visual Feature Normalization

Visual features undergo z-score normalization per feature dimension:

$$\tilde{f}_i = \frac{f_i - \mu_i}{\sigma_i}$$

where $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ are computed across the entire dataset for feature dimension $i$.

## 4. Audio Modality Processing Pipeline

### 4.1 Audio Signal Preprocessing

#### 4.1.1 Resampling and Windowing

Audio signals are resampled to 16kHz and segmented using overlapping windows:

$$w[n] = 0.54 - 0.46\cos\left(\frac{2\pi n}{N-1}\right)$$

This Hamming window reduces spectral leakage with 50% overlap between consecutive frames.

#### 4.1.2 Pre-emphasis

A pre-emphasis filter enhances high frequencies:

$$y[n] = x[n] - \alpha x[n-1]$$

where $\alpha = 0.97$ typically.

### 4.2 COVAREP Feature Extraction

The SDK uses COVAREP (Collaborative Voice Analysis Repository) to extract 74 acoustic features:

#### 4.2.1 Fundamental Frequency (F0) Estimation

The RAPT (Robust Algorithm for Pitch Tracking) algorithm estimates F0 through normalized cross-correlation:

$$R(\tau) = \frac{\sum_{n=0}^{N-1-\tau} x[n]x[n+\tau]}{\sqrt{\sum_{n=0}^{N-1-\tau} x^2[n] \sum_{n=0}^{N-1-\tau} x^2[n+\tau]}}$$

The F0 is determined by finding:

$$\hat{\tau} = \arg\max_{\tau \in [\tau_{min}, \tau_{max}]} R(\tau)$$

$$F_0 = \frac{F_s}{\hat{\tau}}$$

#### 4.2.2 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)

MFCCs are computed through the following process:

1. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**:
$$X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j2\pi kn/N}$$

2. **Mel-scale Filterbank**:
$$m = 2595 \log_{10}\left(1 + \frac{f}{700}\right)$$

3. **Discrete Cosine Transform**:
$$c[n] = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \log(S[m]) \cos\left(n\left(m-0.5\right)\frac{\pi}{M}\right)$$

The SDK extracts 12 MFCCs plus energy, along with their first and second derivatives (delta and delta-delta coefficients):

$$\Delta c[n] = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K} k(c[n+k] - c[n-k])}{2\sum_{k=1}^{K} k^2}$$

#### 4.2.3 Voice Quality Features

COVAREP extracts voice quality parameters including:

1. **Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ)**:
$$NAQ = \frac{f_{ac}}{d_{peak} \cdot F_0}$$

2. **Quasi-Open Quotient (QOQ)**:
$$QOQ = \frac{t_{open}}{T_0}$$

3. **Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)**:
$$HNR = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{harmonic}}{P_{noise}}\right)$$

### 4.3 OpenSMILE Features

The SDK also supports OpenSMILE feature extraction, providing 384 features including:
- Statistical functionals (mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness)
- Regression coefficients
- Percentiles and ranges

## 5. Temporal Alignment Strategy

### 5.1 The Alignment Challenge

The fundamental challenge in multimodal processing is aligning features with different sampling rates:
- Text: Variable rate (word-level timestamps)
- Audio: 100 Hz (10ms frame shift)
- Visual: 30 Hz (33.3ms per frame)

### 5.2 Computational Sequence Representation

The SDK represents each modality as a computational sequence:

$$CS = \{(f_i, [t_{start}^i, t_{end}^i]) | i = 1, ..., n\}$$

where $f_i$ is the feature vector and $[t_{start}^i, t_{end}^i]$ is its temporal interval.

### 5.3 Alignment Algorithm

The alignment process follows these steps:

#### 5.3.1 Reference Selection

One modality (typically text) is selected as the reference:

$$R = \{r_j | j = 1, ..., m\}$$

#### 5.3.2 Projection

Other modalities are projected onto the reference timeline:

$$f_{aligned}^j = \frac{1}{|T_j|} \sum_{t \in T_j} f(t)$$

where $T_j$ is the set of timestamps from the source modality that overlap with reference interval $j$.

#### 5.3.3 Handling Missing Data

For missing segments, the SDK offers three strategies:

1. **Zero padding**:
$$f_{missing} = \vec{0}$$

2. **Forward fill**:
$$f_{missing}(t) = f(t_{last\_valid})$$

3. **Interpolation**:
$$f_{missing}(t) = f(t_1) + \frac{t - t_1}{t_2 - t_1}(f(t_2) - f(t_1))$$

### 5.4 Mathematical Formulation of Alignment

The alignment can be formalized as finding a mapping function:

$$\Phi: \mathbb{R}^{d_1} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_2} \times \mathbb{R}$$

that minimizes temporal distortion:

$$\min_{\Phi} \sum_{i} ||t_i^{aligned} - t_i^{original}||^2$$

subject to monotonicity constraints:

$$t_i < t_j \Rightarrow \Phi(t_i) < \Phi(t_j)$$

## 6. Data Structure and Storage

### 6.1 Hierarchical Data Organization

The SDK organizes data in a hierarchical structure:

```
Dataset
├── Computational Sequence 1 (Text)
│   ├── Segment 1
│   │   ├── features: numpy.array
│   │   └── intervals: numpy.array
│   └── Segment 2
├── Computational Sequence 2 (Audio)
└── Computational Sequence 3 (Visual)
```

### 6.2 HDF5 Storage Format

Data is stored using HDF5 format for efficient access:

```python
file['segment_id']['features'] = feature_array
file['segment_id']['intervals'] = time_intervals
file.attrs['metadata'] = metadata_dict
```

This structure enables:
- Lazy loading of large datasets
- Efficient partial data access
- Compression (typically achieving 3-5x compression ratios)

## 7. Quality Control and Validation

### 7.1 Data Integrity Checks

The SDK implements several validation mechanisms:

#### 7.1.1 Temporal Consistency

$$\forall i < j: t_{end}^i \leq t_{start}^j$$

#### 7.1.2 Feature Dimension Validation

$$\forall f \in CS: \text{dim}(f) = d_{expected}$$

#### 7.1.3 Alignment Verification

The SDK computes alignment quality metrics:

$$Q_{alignment} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i} |gap_i|}{T_{total}}$$

where $gap_i$ represents temporal gaps in the aligned data.

### 7.2 Statistical Validation

Feature distributions are validated against expected ranges:

$$P(f_i \in [min_i, max_i]) > \theta$$

where $\theta$ is a confidence threshold (typically 0.95).

## 8. Computational Complexity Analysis

### 8.1 Time Complexity

The computational complexity for processing a video of length $T$ seconds:

1. **Text Processing**: $O(n \cdot d)$ where $n$ is number of words, $d$ is embedding dimension
2. **Visual Processing**: $O(T \cdot f_v \cdot C_{face})$ where $f_v$ is frame rate, $C_{face}$ is face processing cost
3. **Audio Processing**: $O(T \cdot f_a \cdot \log f_a)$ due to FFT operations
4. **Alignment**: $O(n_1 \cdot n_2)$ for aligning two sequences of lengths $n_1$ and $n_2$

### 8.2 Space Complexity

Storage requirements for processed features:

$$S_{total} = S_{text} + S_{audio} + S_{visual} + S_{metadata}$$

Where:
- $S_{text} = n_{words} \times d_{text} \times 4$ bytes
- $S_{audio} = T \times f_{audio} \times d_{audio} \times 4$ bytes  
- $S_{visual} = T \times f_{visual} \times d_{visual} \times 4$ bytes

Typical storage per minute of video:
- Text: ~1 MB (300-dim GloVe)
- Audio: ~1.8 MB (74-dim COVAREP at 100 Hz)
- Visual: ~0.4 MB (35-dim FACET at 30 Hz)

## 9. Advanced Processing Techniques

### 9.1 Dynamic Time Warping for Alignment

For more sophisticated alignment, the SDK supports Dynamic Time Warping (DTW):

$$DTW(i,j) = d(x_i, y_j) + \min \begin{cases}
DTW(i-1, j) \\
DTW(i, j-1) \\
DTW(i-1, j-1)
\end{cases}$$

This allows for non-linear alignment between modalities with varying temporal dynamics.

### 9.2 Multi-Scale Temporal Modeling

The SDK supports hierarchical temporal representations:

1. **Frame-level**: Raw features at original sampling rate
2. **Segment-level**: Aggregated features over semantic units
3. **Utterance-level**: Global statistics for entire utterances

$$F_{scale}^k = \text{pool}(F_{scale}^{k-1}, w_k)$$

where $w_k$ is the pooling window for scale $k$.

### 9.3 Cross-Modal Attention Mechanisms

Recent versions support attention-based alignment:

$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(score(h_i^{(1)}, h_j^{(2)}))}{\sum_k \exp(score(h_i^{(1)}, h_k^{(2)}))}$$

$$c_i = \sum_j \alpha_{ij} h_j^{(2)}$$

This allows for soft alignment between modalities without rigid temporal constraints.
